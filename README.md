# Jacobi-s_Method
In numerical linear algebra, by Jacobi's method we can find all eigenvalues of a real, symmetric matrix in iterative way. Anyone can go through this following link ( https://nptel.ac.in/content/storage2/courses/108108079/pdf/Unit%204/Unit_4.5.pdf ) to understand the algorithm of this method to implement in C-language.
